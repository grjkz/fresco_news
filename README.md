# READ ME

* This is the code for what I've created for Fresco News' landing page

## Files
Each file's ext will give you an idea of what the file is for:
 * README.md - you're reading it
 * index.html - includes all views/modals in one file
 * index.css - stylesheet for index.html
 * index.js - code for many javascript functions that checks window size and reacts for responsiveness, activating/deactivating Slick.js, that cool scroll-over for the login/signup card, and other stuff
 * landing-gallery.js - the template for creating the news galleries which are appended to the DOM after an AJAX call
